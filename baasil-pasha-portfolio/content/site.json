    "about": "I'm a machine learning researcher and computer science student interested in the intersection of deep learning, systems engineering, and applied research. My work spans computer vision, large language models, and building automation tools that make complex workflows more accessible.\n\nI believe in learning by building—whether that's implementing Vision Transformers from scratch, optimizing inference pipelines, or creating reproducible research tools. I'm drawn to projects that require both theoretical understanding and practical systems thinking.\n\nCurrently seeking internships, research positions, or early-career opportunities in ML engineering, computer vision, or applied AI research where I can contribute to meaningful problems while continuing to grow as both a researcher and engineer.",
